## Contributing

All contribution are welcome!  To get started, clone the repo and create a new feature branch for your work.  If you have an idea for an algorithm to solve an incomplete gameboard, create a sub-package within the 'solver' package.  
All your classes needed to solve a board should be stored within your package.  Same guidelines apply for code to generate a completely filled board, and an incomplete board to be solved by the user or a solver strategy.
